Project Update (11.8.24)

After a couple of years on the backburner, I am resuming this project to evolve it alongside my career growth and technical skills.

Since stepping away from this project, I've primarily focused on development in Mendix, along with enhancing my UI/UX expertise through research and hands-on implementation. Iâ€™ve deepened my skills in CSS and SCSS and worked closely with clients to align their needs with current best practices and popular design technologies.

For this project, my immediate goal is to finalize the existing code and then transition it into a React application. This transition will make the portfolio more adaptable, enabling me to update and reflect new trends and technologies seamlessly. Additionally, I plan to learn and integrate React Native to develop mobile-friendly applications, meeting the mobile-first expectations of many clients.
